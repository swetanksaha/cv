\underline{LTE-Unlicensed/WiFi Co-existence in 5 GHz}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed a WiFi (802.11ac)-based mechanism - \underline{DeMiLTE} for enterprise APs to combat LTE-U/LAA interference.
  \item DeMiLTE enables WiFi APs to detect, quantify and react to LTE interference in real time.
  \item DeMiLTE is light-weight, fully standard-compliant and requires no changes to LTE PHY/MAC.
  \item Implemented as AP-firmware, DeMiLTE improves performance by up to \textbf{110\%}, without modifying clients.
  \item Publised 1 top-tier conference paper and filed 1 patent.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analysis and protocol design for next-generation of WiFi: 60 GHz (802.11ad)-based indoor WLANs.
  \item Instrumented the linux wireless device driver (wil6210) to export PHY/MAC information to userspace.
  \item Modifed the Linux wil6210 driver to allow user control over PHY parameters, like beam direction, in real time.
  \item Undertook an extensive measurement study with the instrumented APs and laptops to study 802.11ad links.
  \item Study highlighted novel challenges and provided insights for practical aspects like coverage and AP deployment.
  \item Published the results of the study in a top-tier conference.

\underline{\link[Funf]{https://www.funf.org/}: Open sensing and data collection framework for Android (acquired by Google)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on Funf-in-a-box (FIAB), a service for users to build custom data collection app with zero programming.
  \item Ported the entire FIAB service from a single Amazon server (AWS) to Google Cloud Services (GCE) in 1 month.
  \item Switch from always-on architecture on AWS to on-demand on GCE greatly reduced costs/increased performance.
  \item Added support for configuring and deploying custom surveys and capturing additional user input.
